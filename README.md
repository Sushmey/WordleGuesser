# WordleGuesser
A website that gives you possible 5 letter words from potential letters and excluded letters to get an edge on others to solve daily wordles from https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

# What you'll need
A module bundler to bundle the npm library with the frontend. I've used webpack here.

# How to run?
Clone the repo and run 
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
which will then create a dist(short for distribution) folder with ```main.js``` file which will be your bundled JavaScript file 
and then finally, open ```index.html``` in any browser
